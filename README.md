# Linear-Regression
Performing Linear Regression on a simple dataset. The data is about an Ecommerce Customers from a company where they can buy products from either on a mobile app or website. The dataset has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:
- Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
- Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
- Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
- Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

Goal is to decide whether to focus efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

What should the company focus on? This is tricky, there are two ways to think about this: Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that is what is working better. This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, one would probably want to explore the relationship between Length of Membership and the App or the Website before coming to a conclusion!
